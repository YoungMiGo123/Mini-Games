The Pong Game is a Simple 2D Game. The goal of the game is to hit the ball with the paddle using the controls below.

* You start off the game with four lives. Each time you miss the ball and it hits the lower edge of the playground(canvas) you lose a 'life'
if your lives goes to zero you lose and have to start over.

* The aim of the game is to get as many points of the score board as you possibly can and have fun while doing it. 

The Controls Are: 'Left Arrow Key' == 'left'
		  'Right Arrow Key' == 'Right'
	          'P - Pause'
	          'R - Restart Game'
   	          'S - Start Game'

*One of the main functions that is used in this game are Timers which update the screen causing motion. An example of this is in the TextBook "Think Sharply Part 2" on Page 179 
*This game also makes use of various event handling, like key binding which control the paddle. An example of this is in the the Textbook Part on page 179
*In this game I also made use of sound effects by using The 'SoundPlayer class' an example of this is on page 191 in the Textbook but also on Line Number 79,86.
*This game uses the Canvas class extensively to find the position of images on the canvas to up date their location. An e.g is on page 180 in the textbook
*For this game I also made use of the brush class to make the background change colour each time the paddle touches the ball. refer to line 198 where the method is instanciated and line 249 where its used.
